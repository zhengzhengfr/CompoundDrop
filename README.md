# Compound-drop-code
Numerical codes for compound drop impact

This is the numerical codes (based on the Basilisk open-source software, basilisk.fr) used to produce the numerical results presented in the paper.
Note that the Basilisk should be installed before running these codes.
Note also that 0constants-cs.h, 0impactCompoundSolid-water.c and 0two-phaseDOD.h are for numerical simulations while images.c, output_position.c and volume_bubble.c are for post-processing.
Basically, to run in parallel, type these command lines one by one (28 means number of cores used):

qcc -source -D_MPI=1 0impactCompoundSolid-water.c 

mpicc -O2 -Wall -std=c99 -D_MPI=1 _0impactCompoundSolid-water.c -o cs -lm

mpirun -np 28 ./cs

And to run in serial:

qcc -O2 -Wall 0impactCompoundSolid-water.c -o cs -lm -L$BASILISK/gl -lglutils -lfb_osmesa -lGLU -lOSMesa -lm

./cs
